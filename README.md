# Lab for Switching Configuration and VLAN Implementation
This project was finished as a requirement for Queensborough Community College's (CUNY) Networking Fundamentals II course.

## Summary
The lab's main objectives were to configure network switches using the Cisco IOS CLI, create VLANs, secure ports, and confirm Layer 2 and Layer 3 communication between linked devices.

## Important Tasks
- Created, named, assigned ports to, and deleted VLANs on a Cisco 3550 switch.
- IP addresses were assigned and Switch Virtual Interfaces (SVIs) were deployed for remote access and management.
- By assigning particular MAC addresses to switch ports, port security was put into place.
- To maximize network performance, manually configure duplex modes and port speeds.
- Ping and IP configuration verification were used to test the connectivity between workstations assigned to VLANs.
- Used the `show vlan brief`, `show interfaces`, and `show port-security` commands for basic troubleshooting and verification.

## Utilized Technologies: 
- Cisco IOS CLI (Routers and Switches) VLANs and Ethernet switching
- Windows OS (for workstation IP configuration)
- Basic TCP/IP networking
- Putty (to access the console)
- Wireshark (optional for further packet analysis) 

## Skills Exhibited:
- Layer 2 segmentation and VLAN administration Configuring the Switch Virtual Interface (SVI) for Layer 3 administration Configuring and enforcing port security
- Setting up the default gateway and assigning IP addresses
- Debugging Layer 2 and Layer 3 network connectivity
