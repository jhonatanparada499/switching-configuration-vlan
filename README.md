# Lab for Switching Configuration and VLAN Implementation

This project was finished as a requirement for Queensborough Community College's (CUNY) Networking Fundamentals II course.

## Summary
The lab's main objectives were to configure network switches using the Cisco IOS CLI, create VLANs, secure ports, and confirm Layer 2 and Layer 3 communication between linked devices.

## Important Tasks
- Created, named, assigned ports to, and deleted VLANs on a Cisco 3550 switch.
IP addresses were assigned and Switch Virtual Interfaces (SVIs) were deployed for remote access and management.
By assigning particular MAC addresses to switch ports, port security was put into place.
To maximize network performance, manually configure duplex modes and port speeds.
Ping and IP configuration verification were used to test the connectivity between workstations assigned to VLANs.
